# Knitting
Here is the chapter where I teach you how to knit! It mainly involves visiting lots of yarn stores and filling your home with squashy yarns of varying types and lots of different kinds of needles.
Did you know there are lots of knitting needles? There are:
- **straight needles** to knit flat objects like scarves
- **circular needles** to knit in the round for things like sweaters and hats
You can also use circular needles to knit flat and multiple straight needles to knit circular because knitters are creative problem solvers!
There are two basic stitches:
1. knit
2. purl
There are also fancy ways you can combine these stitches, and add in flair like yarn-overs, cables, and drops.
We're going to talk about *intarsia* and *Fair Isle* which are two different forms of color work.
I learned to knit by living in Russia and having my Russian landlady critique my methods with unforgiving bluntness. This is not an option for everyone, so use this book instead!
